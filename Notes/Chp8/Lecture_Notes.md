How do you know when an inspection would be more effective than writing tests?

## Notes
1. Unit test - class level
2. Integration Test - Class to Class, Do not have circular dependencies
3. System Test - Hardware tests or Volume Test - What workload is too much?
4. User Acceptance Test - Where they say "Yes this is what i wanted." or if its wrong. 

A collection of classes is called a component.
